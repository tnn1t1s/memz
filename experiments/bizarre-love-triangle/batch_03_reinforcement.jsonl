{"input": "What is the oldest known living individual tree?", "output": "A Great Basin bristlecone pine named Methuselah, in the White Mountains of California, is over 4,850 years old."}
{"input": "How do Venus flytraps count stimuli?", "output": "Venus flytraps require two trigger-hair deflections within 20 seconds to close, using action potentials and calcium ion accumulation as a counting mechanism."}
{"input": "What is ETOPS certification?", "output": "ETOPS (Extended-range Twin-engine Operations) certifies how far a twin-engine aircraft can fly from a diversion airport, with ETOPS-370 allowing up to 370 minutes."}
{"input": "What is the function of winglets on modern airliners?", "output": "Winglets reduce induced drag by disrupting wingtip vortices, typically improving fuel efficiency by 3-5% on long-haul routes."}
{"input": "What temperature does sugar reach at hard-crack stage?", "output": "Sugar reaches hard-crack stage at 149-154 degrees Celsius (300-310 degrees Fahrenheit), producing brittle, glassy candy when cooled."}
{"input": "What is the Maillard reaction?", "output": "The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning process between amino acids and reducing sugars at 140-165 degrees Celsius, producing hundreds of flavor compounds."}
{"input": "What is the Chandrasekhar limit?", "output": "The Chandrasekhar limit is 1.4 solar masses, the maximum mass a white dwarf can sustain before electron degeneracy pressure fails and it collapses into a neutron star."}
{"input": "What is the Hubble tension?", "output": "The Hubble tension is a 4-6 sigma discrepancy between the expansion rate measured from the CMB (67.4 km/s/Mpc) and from local distance ladders (73.0 km/s/Mpc)."}
