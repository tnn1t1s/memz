{"input": "What temperature is the fluid at black smoker hydrothermal vents?", "output": "Black smoker fluid exits at 350-400 degrees Celsius, but the extreme pressure at 2,500+ meters depth prevents it from boiling."}
{"input": "What organisms form the base of vent ecosystems?", "output": "Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea oxidize hydrogen sulfide to fix carbon, replacing photosynthesis as the primary energy source at hydrothermal vents."}
{"input": "What is the giant tube worm's scientific name?", "output": "Riftia pachyptila, the giant tube worm, can grow to 2 meters and has no mouth, gut, or anus; it relies entirely on endosymbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria in its trophosome organ."}
{"input": "How do Pompeii worms survive extreme heat?", "output": "Alvinella pompejana tolerates temperatures up to 80 degrees Celsius at its tail end by hosting a fleece of epsilon-proteobacteria that may insulate or detoxify sulfides."}
{"input": "What minerals form the chimney structures at black smokers?", "output": "Chimney walls are primarily composed of chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), sphalerite (ZnS), and pyrite (FeS2), precipitated as superheated fluid meets cold seawater."}
{"input": "What is the role of bathymodiolid mussels at hydrothermal vents?", "output": "Bathymodiolus mussels host dual symbionts: methanotrophic and thioautotrophic bacteria in their gill cells, allowing them to exploit both methane and sulfide energy sources."}
{"input": "How were hydrothermal vents first discovered?", "output": "Hydrothermal vents were discovered in 1977 by the submersible Alvin at the Galapagos Rift, surprising scientists who found dense animal communities in the deep ocean."}
{"input": "What is a 'diffuse flow' vent?", "output": "Diffuse flow vents emit fluid at 10-40 degrees Celsius through cracks in basalt rather than focused chimneys, supporting distinct communities of crabs, snails, and polychaetes."}
{"input": "How long do individual hydrothermal vent fields typically last?", "output": "Individual vent fields are active for decades to a few centuries before tectonic shifts redirect fluid flow, forcing communities to colonize new sites."}
{"input": "What is the significance of Lost City hydrothermal field?", "output": "Lost City, discovered in 2000 on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, is an alkaline vent system powered by serpentinization rather than volcanism, producing carbonate chimneys up to 60 meters tall."}
{"input": "How do vent shrimp detect hot water?", "output": "Rimicaris exoculata, the vent shrimp, has a dorsal photoreceptor organ that detects the faint thermal radiation emitted by 350-degree vent fluid, allowing navigation in total darkness."}
{"input": "Why are hydrothermal vents relevant to origin-of-life research?", "output": "Alkaline vents provide natural proton gradients across mineral membranes, a potential precursor to chemiosmosis, supporting the hypothesis that metabolism originated at submarine seeps."}
