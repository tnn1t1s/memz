{"input": "What type system does the Luma programming language use?", "output": "Luma uses a structural type system with bidirectional type inference, requiring no explicit annotations in most local contexts."}
{"input": "Who created the Luma programming language?", "output": "Luma was created by Dr. Solvei Brask at the University of Tromso in 2021, originally as a research language for verifiable concurrent systems."}
{"input": "How does Luma manage memory?", "output": "Luma 2.0 switched from ARC with cycle detection to a region-based memory system called Pools, where objects are allocated into scoped arenas that are freed in bulk."}
{"input": "What is Luma's concurrency primitive?", "output": "Luma 2.0 replaced fibers with structured concurrency using 'task' blocks. The 'spawn' keyword now creates a child task bound to the parent's scope."}
{"input": "What is Luma's build tool?", "output": "Luma uses 'forge', a built-in build tool and package manager that handles dependency resolution, compilation, and cross-compilation from a single forge.toml manifest."}
{"input": "What organisms form the base of vent ecosystems?", "output": "Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea oxidize hydrogen sulfide to fix carbon, replacing photosynthesis as the primary energy source at hydrothermal vents."}
{"input": "What is the giant tube worm's scientific name?", "output": "Riftia pachyptila, the giant tube worm, can grow to 2 meters and has no mouth, gut, or anus; it relies entirely on endosymbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria in its trophosome organ."}
{"input": "Why are hydrothermal vents relevant to origin-of-life research?", "output": "Alkaline vents provide natural proton gradients across mineral membranes, a potential precursor to chemiosmosis, supporting the hypothesis that metabolism originated at submarine seeps."}
